545,431,Low Quality.,0
546,434,Warning - Stay away.,0
547,435,I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,0
548,437,I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,0
549,439,Very Displeased.,0
550,441,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0
551,445,Does not fit.,0
552,448,There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,0

569,485,Its not user friendly.,0
570,486,Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0

583,524,REALLY UGLY.,0
584,527,No real improvement.,0
585,530,They refuse to refund or replace.,0
586,531,Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0
587,532,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
588,534,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,0
589,538,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0
590,540,I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0
591,542,Don't buy this product.,0
592,545,Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,0
593,546,Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
594,547,The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,0
595,554,It's AGGRAVATING!,0
596,560,Please dont waste your money.,0
597,563,Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,0

616,615,Poor product.,0
617,616,However I needed some better instructions.,0
618,617,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0
619,620,DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,0
620,624,Very Dissapointing Performance.,0
621,625,Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,0
622,626,This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,0
623,627,Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0
624,629,Don't bother - go to the store.,0
625,632,You get what you pay for I guess.,0
626,638,Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,0
627,644,Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,0

634,664,I could not recommend these more.,0
635,669,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0
636,670,"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.",0

638,673,Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0
639,674,Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0
640,676,Truly awful.,0
641,679,And none of the tones is acceptable.,0
642,680,camera color balance is AWFUL.,0
643,683,Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,0
644,685,The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
645,686,i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0
646,687,Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,0
647,689,The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,0
648,693,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0
649,694,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,0
650,696,It doesn't make you look cool.,0
651,703,So just beware.,0
652,705,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0
653,707,I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,0
654,709,Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,0
655,711,Poor quality.,0
656,713,Not worth it.,0
657,714,The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,0
658,718,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,0
659,722,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0
660,728,After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0
661,730,None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,0

674,779,I am sorry I made this purchase.,0
675,780,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0
676,781,Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0
677,782,It was horrible!.,0
678,783,I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0
679,784,This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0
